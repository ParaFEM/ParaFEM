The file "job.xt" is an example PBS batch script that can be used on the 
Cray XT4 and Cray XT6 systems provided by the UK HECToR service. "job.xe6" is 
for the Cray XE6 system.

  Usage: qsub job.xt
  

PBS COMMANDS EXPLAINED

#PBS -A <my_account>        The account code to which the job is charged.
#PBS -N ParaFEM             The name of the job. Here it is "ParaFEM".
#PBS -l mppwidth=8          The total number of MPI tasks
#PBS -l mppnppn=4           The number of MPI tasks per compute node
#PBS -l walltime=00:19:59   The maximum wall clock time required by the job
#PBS -j oe                  Send job output & error messages to ParaFEM.o* file


NOTES

 o The variables "mppwidth" and "mppnppn" can have different meanings depending
   on the system. Here, the meanings are those used in the HECToR service. 
   Please consult the user guide provided with your system.

 o The variable "mppnppn" can be set to 1, 2, 3 or 4 on HECToR Phase2a and from
   1 to 24 on HECToR Phase 2b. The significance is the number of MPI tasks per
   compute node. HECToR Phase 2a has one quad core processor per node and 
   HECToR Phase 2b has two 12-core processors per node.
 
 o Useful PBS commands
   - $qstat          Check status of all jobs in the queue 
   - $qdel <job_id>  Delete the job with the PBS job number <job_id>

 o Script job.xe6 gives an example of how to reserve one core per node using 
   the aprun switch -r. A full explanation can be found using $man aprun.
