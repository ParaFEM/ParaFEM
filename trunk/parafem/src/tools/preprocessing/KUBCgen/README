  PROGRAM: KUBCgen
  
  KUBCgen is a very simple program that outputs various *.fix, *.bnd, and *.dat files for the purposes of determining bulk properties of cubes of material using FEA.
  
  The program is designed to be run on output from simpleware includes 6 nsets, and has been run through inp2pf.  
  
    Usage: KUBCgen <jobname>
    
    		e.g. KUBCgen foam
    		
    Output: 18 files; *.dat, *.fix, and *.bnd for:
    
    	  o Compression in the X-axis
  	    o Compression in the Y-axis
 	      o Compression in the Z-axis
        o Shear along x-axis
        o Shear along y-axis
        o Shear along z-axis
        
  You can then run ./KUBCtidy to move all the files accordingly into seperate folders for xcompression, xshear, ycompression etc.  Note, if gives each input deck generic names, so you can alter the script or rename the files manually if this is a problem.
