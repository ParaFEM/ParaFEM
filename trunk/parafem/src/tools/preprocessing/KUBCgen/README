  PROGRAM: KUBCgen
  
  KUBCgen is a very simple program that outputs various *.fix, *.bnd, and *.dat files for the purposes of determining bulk properties of cubes of material using FEA.
  
  The program is designed to be run on output from simpleware includes 6 nsets, and has been run through inp2d.  
  
    Usage: KUBCgen <jobname>
    
    		e.g. KUBCgen foam
    		
    Output: 18 files; *.dat, *.fix, and *.bnd for:
    
    	  o Compression in the X-axis
  	    o Compression in the Y-axis
 	      o Compression in the Z-axis
        o Shear along x-axis
        o Shear along y-axis
        o Shear along z-axis
        
      User must then rename/copy&paste *.d accordingly to produce a full parafem p121 dataset.  I'll write a bash script eventually.
