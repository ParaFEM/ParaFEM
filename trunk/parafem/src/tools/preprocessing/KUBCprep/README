  PROGRAM: KUBCprep
  
  KUBCprep is a very simple shell script that appends loading conditions to the end of an inp file for the purposes of determining bulk properties of cubes of material using FEA.
  
  The program is designed to be run on output from simpleware.  Usage with ParaFEM requires running the tool "inp2d" on the files produced by this script.
  
    Usage: KUBCprep <filename.inp> <sizeOfCube>
    
    		e.g. KUBCprep foam.inp 9.95e-3
    		
    Output: Six files, of identical mesh to the input file, but with loads corresponding to:
    	  o Compression in the X-axis
  	    o Compression in the Y-axis
 	      o Compression in the Z-axis
        o Shear along x-axis
        o Shear along y-axis
        o Shear along z-axis
