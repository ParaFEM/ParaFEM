The programs in the umat directory are modified versions of the programs found
in Chapter 12 of Smith I.M. and Griffiths D.V. "Programming the Finite Element
Method", Edition 4, Wiley, 2004.

Modifications here also include integration of UMAT support to differentiate from the sg12 directory programs.

Empty folders are place holders for programs being ported from the book.
