PROGRAMS: Boundary Element Method

The programs in the BSD8 directory are modified versions of the programs found
in Chapter 8 of Beer G, Smith I.M. and Duenser C "The Boundary Element Method 
with Programming", Springer-Verlag, 2008.

Please note that prog81.f90 and prog82.f90 are serial programs and can be 
compiled with a standard compiler. Program prog83.f90 is a parallel program and
must be linked to an MPI library.
