  PROGRAM: p125.f90

  p125 conduction equation on a 3-d box volume using 8-node hexahedral 
  elements and a simple explicit algorithm. The program is a modified 
  version of the one published in Smith I.M. and Griffiths D.V., 
  "Programming the Finite Element Method", 4th Edition, Wiley, 2004.

    Usage: p125 <job_name>

  The original program from the book, p125.f90 has been modified slightly
  to work with this version of ParaFEM.
