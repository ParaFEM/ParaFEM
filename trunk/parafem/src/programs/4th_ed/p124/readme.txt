  PROGRAM: p124.f90

  p124 solves the conduction equation using 8-node hexahedral elements.
  Implicit integration in time using the 'theta' method. The program is a 
  modified version of the one published in Smith I.M. and Griffiths D.V., 
  "Programming the Finite Element Method", 4th Edition, Wiley, 2004.

    Usage: p124 <job_name>

  The original program from the book, p124.f90 has been modified slightly
  to work with this version of ParaFEM.
