  3. SVN update
  4. Type: make-parafem-win32.bat
  5. Add the executables to the PATH: set PATH=%PATH%;D:\parafem\parafem\bin
  
  CREATE INPUT DECK
  
  1. Use program rfemcube.exe with input *.rf from /examples/rfem
  2. Use program rfembc.exe with input created from rfemcube.exe
  3. Use program rfemfield.exe with the output created by (1) and (2)
  4. Repeat (3) for as many instances as required
  
  SOLVE THE EQUATIONS
  
  1. Use Windows prompt and use rfemsolve.exe
  
  POSTPROCESSING
  
  1. Open cygwin navigate to the working directory
  2. Use the instruction: export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/d/parafem/parafem/bin
  3. Copy the postprocessing tool pf2ensi to /bin -> cp src/tools/postprocessing/pf2ensi/pf2ensi* bin
  4. Transform the output data of rfemsolve with the instruction -> < pf2ense> <output-rfemsolve>
  5. Use ParaView and open the file with extension .case
    
  ISSUES
  
  1. The argument <mises-threshold> needs to be removed from rfemcube.exe
