  PROGRAM: xx12.f90
  
  These are the necessary files to simulate a mixed boundary condition heat 
  diffusion problem for a cube geometry (hexahedral elements). Nodes are 
  given an initial temperature value which with time will gradually reach
  equilibrium due to both fixed and loaded nodes.
  
  A range of mesh denities are provided within this directory.
