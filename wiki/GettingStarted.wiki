#summary How to download and install ParaFEM.

== Getting the code ==
 * Checkout the latest version of source code or download a more robust release (when available). 
 * ParaFEM uses the _subversion_ version control system (svn). Follow the instructions under the [http://code.google.com/p/parafem/source/checkout Source] tab. 
 * You may also need to see how to use svn on your local supercomputer or cluster. 
 * On HECToR (UK National HPC Facility), svn needs to be loaded. To do this type _$module load svn_ at the command prompt.

== Building the ParaFEM Library ==
 * In ~/parafem/src/modules create a makefile for your system or use an existing one.
 * Type: make -f makemodules.xt4 (for a Cray XT4 system)
 * Type: make -f makemodules.xt4 install (moves the .mod files to ~/parafem/include and the .a file to ~/parafem/lib)

== Building a ParaFEM Program == 
 * If you wish to use an existing program, change to the appropriate directory and build it. For example:
 * Change directory to ~/parafem/src/programs/sg12/p121
 * Type: make -f makeprograms
 * Example input decks can be found in the ~/parafem/examples/p121 directory
