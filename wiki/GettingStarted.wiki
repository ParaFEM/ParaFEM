At the moment, you can either checkout the latest version of source code directly from the repository _or_ download a release version. Choose which method you wish to use and follow the instructions below.

== Checkout the latest version of source code ==
 * ParaFEM uses the _subversion_ version control system (svn). Follow the instructions under the [http://code.google.com/p/parafem/source/checkout Source] tab. 
 * You may also need to see how to use {{{svn}}} on your local supercomputer or cluster. 
 * On HECToR (UK National HPC Facility), svn needs to be loaded. To do this type {{{module load svn}}} at the command prompt.
 * To update an existing installation, use the command {{{svn update}}} instead of {{{svn checkout}}}

== Download a release version ==
 * Go to the [http://tinyurl.com/parafem-download official download page] and click to download the latest stable release of the source code, currently [http://www.parafem.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=97:parafem-version-20819-now-released&catid=33:parafem-news&Itemid=66 version 2.0.819].
 * Select a directory in which to install ParaFEM.
 * Unzip the archive
  * {{{gzip -d ParaFEM_src.2.0.819.tgz}}} 
 * Untar the archive
  * {{{tar xvf ParaFEM_src.2.0.819.tar}}}
 * You should now see all the source code expanded in your chosen directory.

== Building ParaFEM ==
 * In the directory {{{~/parafem/build}}} create a {{{<system>.inc}}} file for your system or use an existing one. If you create a new one, please send to the project owner for inclusion in the next ParaFEM release.
 * In the top parafem directory type:
  * {{{make-parafem MACHINE=<system>}}}
 * *NOTE* If rebuilding after a source code update, remove the old files by typing: 
  * {{{make-parafem clean}}}
 * If successful, all the ParaFEM programs will be installed in the directory {{{~/parafem/bin}}}.
