#summary About the ParaFEM project

== ParaFEM ==

The first version of ParaFEM was developed by L. Margetts under the supervision of I.M. Smith and M.A. Pettipher:

{{{Margetts L. (2002), "Parallel Finite Element Analysis", PhD Thesis, University of Manchester, UK.}}}

After this, ParaFEM formed the basis for Chapter 12 in Smith I.M. and Griffiths D.V. "Programming the Finite Element Method", Wiley, 2004. ParaFEM is also used for parallel boundary element analysis in Beer G., Smith I.M. and Duenser C. "The Boundary Element Method with Programming", Springer, 2008. 

The following projects are contributing to the ongoing development of ParaFEM:

 * [http://wiki.rcs.manchester.ac.uk/community/EC4aPDEs EC4aPDEs - DEISA Extreme Computing Initiative]
 * [http://wiki.rcs.manchester.ac.uk/community/BigDino BigDino - DEISA Extreme Computing Initiative project]

== Status of the Google Code Repository ==

Independently of the projects listed above, L. Margetts is currently transferring software developed by himself and various contributors from a closed university repository to this open Google Code platform. This effort started on 8 March 2010 and will take a while to complete, especially as L. Margetts is re-engineering and documenting the code as it is transferred. In the mean time, please see http://www.parafem.org.uk for further details or contact L. Margetts about code that is not already available here.
