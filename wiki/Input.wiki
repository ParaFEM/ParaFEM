== Content of the ".d" file ==

The ".d" format is based on the DANFE format created by Dr Daniel Kidger, a former Lecturer at the University of Manchester. ".d" files can be viewed in the [ParaFEMViewerManual ParaFEM-Viewer].

A typical ".d" file has the following format:

{{{
*THREE_DIMENSIONAL
*NODES
nodeID x-coordinate y-coordinate z-coordinate
*ELEMENTS''
elementID ndim nod type num materialID
}}}

||*Variable Name*||*Type*||*Purpose*||
||{{{*THREE_DIMENSIONAL}}} || Character || A keyword describing the model as three dimensional. ||
||'*'NODES || Character || A keyword marking the start of a list of nodes and their coordinates. ||
||'*'ELEMENTS || Character || A keyword marking the start of a list of element data. ||
||nodeID || Integer || A unique number that identifies the node. PalaeoFEM assumes sequential numbering from 1 to nn. ||
||x-coordinate || Real || The x-coordinate of the node. ||
||y-coordinate || Real || The y-coordinate of the node. ||
||z-coordinate || Real || The z-coordinate of the node. ||
||elementID || Integer || A unique number that identifies the element. PalaeoFEM assumes sequential numbering from 1 to nels.||
||ndim || Integer || The number of dimensions. PalaeoFEM only supports 3D elements. ||
||nod || Integer || The number of nodes in the element. PalaeoFEM only supports the values 4, 8, 10, 20: 4-node tetrahedra, 8-node hexahedra, 10-node tetrahedra and 20-node hexahedra. ||
||type || Integer || Code for element type. Default is 1.||
||num || Integer List || A list of nodes that belong to the element. 4 nodes are expected for 4-node tetrahedra, 8 nodes for 8-node hexahedra and so on. Refer to Smith and Griffiths for the correct node ordering.||
||materialID || Integer || A number that identifies which material properties to select for the element.||

A real example follows:

{{{
*THREE_DIMENSIONAL
*NODES
1   15.0989017   2.49846721  0.940066218
2   15.0960474   2.40614152  0.983345568
3   15.0937481   2.51739144  0.975006104
4   15.0070047   2.48403239  0.964258492
5   15.1986771    2.4753387  0.957266092
*ELEMENTS
1  3  4  1  1  2  3  4  1
2  3  4  1  5  2  3  1  1
}}}

Note that in the '*'ELEMENTS section, ABAQUS would have:

{{{
1  1  2  3  4
2  5  2  3  1 
}}}

So, in this case, if you were converting an Abaqus .inp file to ParaFEM ASCII format manually, you need to insert 3 4 1 and 1.

{{{
1  3  4  1  1  2  3  4  1
2  3  4  1  5  2  3  1  1
}}}
