== Smith and Griffiths, 4th Edition ==

The program names in this section are those used in Chapter 12. For example, p121 is program number 1 in Chapter 12 (p12.1). In the book, these programs can only execute hard coded problem types. Here, in ParaFEM, the equivalent programs allow the user to read in problems generated using a third party meshing tool. 

_Note: Some of the programs here are still being ported to the Google Code repository. These are marked "under development"._

== Smith, Griffiths and Margetts, 5th Edition (in preparation) ==

The programs in this section are being developed for the 5th edition of "Programming the Finite Element Method." It is too early to allocate program names on the basis of Chapter and program number. Therefore the programs have been given temporary names. These will change when the book is published.

_Note: Some of the programs here are under development._
