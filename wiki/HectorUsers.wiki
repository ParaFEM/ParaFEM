= Submitting Jobs to the Batch Queue =

 * Locate the batch script called _run.xt4_ in _~/parafem/etc/batchscripts_. Modify the items in brackets.
 * <arguments> refers to the job_name. If the job_name is _p121_ then replace <arguments> with _p121_. Program _p121_ will then expect to find the input files _p121.dat, p121.bnd, p121.d_ and _p121.lds_. The job_name could be anything. 
 * Copy the executable program (eg _p121_), the input files (_p121.dat, p121.bnd, p121.d_ and _p121.lds_) and the batchscript (_run.xt4_) to the _/work/projectID/projectID/userID_ directory.
 * Change directory to _/work/projectID/projectID/userID_
 * To submit the job, type _$qsub run.xt4_
 * To check the status of the job in the queue, type _$qstat_
 * For further information about the batch queues and batch scripts, consult the user documentation on the HECToR webpages.
