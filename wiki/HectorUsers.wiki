= Introduction =

[http://www.hector.ac.uk HECToR] is the UK's National HPC Service. This page contains some pointers for ParaFEM users who wish to run the code on HECToR.

= Getting an Account =

To apply for an account, please see the following [http://www.hector.ac.uk/howcan/admin/ webpage].

= Common Commands =

 * Login: {{{$ssh <username>@phase2b.hector.ac.uk}}}
 * Change password: {{{$passwd}}}

= Submitting Jobs to the Batch Queue =

 * Locate the batch script called _run.xt4_ in _~/parafem/etc/batchscripts_. Modify the items in brackets.
 * {{{<arguments>}}} refers to the job_name. If the job_name is _p121_ then replace {{{<arguments>}}} with _p121_. Program _p121_ will then expect to find the input files _p121.dat, p121.bnd, p121.d_ and _p121.lds_. Note that the job_name is user defined. 
 * Copy the executable program (eg _p121_), the input files (_p121.dat, p121.bnd, p121.d_ and _p121.lds_) and the batchscript (_run.xt4_) to the _/work/projectID/projectID/userID_ directory.
 * Change directory to _/work/projectID/projectID/userID_
 * To submit the job, type _$qsub run.xt4_
 * To check the status of the job in the queue, type _$qstat_
 * For further information about the batch queues and batch scripts, consult the user documentation on the HECToR webpages. 

= Known Issue on HECToR Phase2b =

If the job fails and you get output similar to the below, execute the following commands:

 * {{{$make -f makemodules.xt clean}}} for the library 
 * {{{$make -f makeprograms.xt clean}}} for the program
 * {{{$module add xtpe-mc12}}}

Then rebuild the library and program.
