IAC Common Components
---------------------

This directory ( iac_proj/common/ ) contains all the V code, source code,
HTML documentation, and installation information for the IAC Common 
components. These libraries contain a variety of macros that are common to
a number of IAC projects, such as the standard User Interface macros. The
macros should also be of general use to many visualization projects. The
components are packaged in the same way as all other IAC Projects.

The directory should be placed into your existing project directory, which
should already contain the IAC Project File structure, i.e., the iac_proj/,
iac_lib/ and v/ directories.

The file INSTALL contains information on how to edit the existing IAC
files: a single line addition to the iac_proj/iac_proj.v file, to add the
new Common project, and additions to one or more of files in the iac_lib/
directory, to link appropriate objects to the top-level IAC library page.

Once the files have been correctly installed, the low-level modules of the new
project may be compiled. If you opt to leave the process unspecified, it will
by default use the "express" process. Doing so means the module may be
compiled by using one of the following commands in the top-level directory of
your project (whilst AVS/Express is not running):

	base -comp_proc express -exit
or
	make -f express.mk

	Using the 'make' command, requires that the express.mk file already
exists, and has been updated accordingly.

	If you modify the Common project, and elect to specify the process
as "user" or another user-defined process, then the module may be compiled
without having to exit the AVS/Express application. Use the following command
in the VCP to compile the module:

	$compile IAC_PROJ.Common.CommonMods

	Users of the Developer's Edition may select the module in the 
relevant Templates library, and choose 'compile' from the Project menu.

Files
-----

The following files can be found in the iac_proj/common/ directory.

INSTALL 	Contains installation instructions for editing the iac_proj.v
		and iac_lib/ files. This file should not be edited as the
		future installation script will use this file.

common.v	Creates the IAC_PROJ.Common library.

cmn-mods.v	Creates the CommonMods library containing the low-level
		modules TrueFalseCore, BreakLinkCore and RandomNumCore.

		SmartTextTypein, SmartFieldTypein, titleLabel, mainTitleLabel,
		IAC_StandardUI and the parameter group SmartTypeinParams.

io-wdgts.v	Creates the IOWidgets library containing the macros
		CreateIndexedFilename, CreateIndexedFilenameUI,
		createIndexedFilename, AnimFilename, AnimFilenameUI,

Generated Files
---------------

When the project is compiled, the following files will be generated. Once
compiled, you may safely remove these files; any future recompilations
will regenerate these files.

gen.h	        AVS/Express generated header file.

gen.cxx	        AVS/Express generated source code.

bklmod.o        Intermediate object files.
tfmod.o
randmod.o
