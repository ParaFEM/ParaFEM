  !*    MODULE: choose_solvers
  !*  SYNOPSIS
  !*    Usage:      USE choose_solvers
  !*  FUNCTION
  !*    Contains data and subroutines that are used to choose between different
  !*    solver libraries, currently the solvers provided by ParaFEM and by
  !*    PETSc.
  !*    
  !*    Subroutine             Purpose
  !*
  !*    get_solvers            Gets the type of solvers to use
  !*    solvers_valid          Test the the solvers string is valid
  !*    solvers_list           Return a list of valid solvers
