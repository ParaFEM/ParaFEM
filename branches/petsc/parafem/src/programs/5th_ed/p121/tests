# Describes parameters for regression rest for this executable
# This file is read by test.sh which is invoked by the 'make test' target

# The base directory in which the demo input/output files are kept
demo_file_path="../../../../examples/5th_ed/${driver_name}/demo"

## ##TEST [0] - Example test

## The file to examine. 
# test_file[0]="${driver_name}_demo.res"
## NB ${driver_name} is inherited from the call to test.sh, Typically the current directory name. e.g. p121

## The pattern to match the line to test. To pass, lines matching this pattern must be the same after execution as in the demo_file_path
# test_pattern[0]="The number of iterations to convergence was"

## Real tests 

## Test 0
test_file[0]="${driver_name}_demo.res"
test_pattern[0]="The number of iterations to convergence was"

## Test 1
test_file[1]="${driver_name}_demo.res"
test_pattern[1]="The total load is"
