This folder contains the source code and makefile for the pf2metin
and metout2pf pre-processing tools to support PARTITIONING of input
decks using the METIS partitioning library and tools.

The METIS library and tools must also be downloaded, compiled and
installed on your system to make use of these ParaFEM tools.

METIS can be obtained from:
      http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download

These tools were compiled and tested against VERSION 4.0.3.

pf2metin
  This program takes a ParaFEM input deck (.d file) and
  pre-processes it by transforming it into the file format
  required for use by the METIS Partitioning library and tools.

  USAGE:
  pf2metin <input_model_filename> <output_model_filename>
  e.g., pf2metin helix.d helix.met

metout2pf
  This program takes an unpartitioned ParaFEM input deck
  (.d, .bnd, .lds) and a METIS output partition file and outputs
  a new ParaFEM input deck (.d, .bnd, .lds AND .psize) that
  incorporates the partitioning information.
  
  NOTE: if the BND or LDS files are not present, they will not be
  processed but the program will exit after processing the model
  files.

  NOTE: the METIS partition programs (partnmesh/partdmesh) will
  output TWO partition files, with the suffix of .epart.# or
  .npart.#, where # matches the number of partitions specified
  when the partition programs were executed. The epart.# file
  should be used for this program.
 
  NOTE: ParaFEM .fix files are not supported.
  
  USAGE:
    metout2pf <partition_file> <input_basename> <output_basename>
    e.g., metout2pf helix.met.epart.3 helix helix_part
 
  NOTE: use the basename i.e., without the .d suffix.
  
WORKFLOW

  The overall workflow for partitioning ParaFEM input decks is as
  follows:

    e.g., pf2metin helix.d helix.met
          partnmesh helix.met 3
          metout2pf helix.met.epart.3 helix helix_part

  This will generate helix_part.d and helix_part.psize files. It
  will also generate helix_part.bnd and helix_part.lds if those
  input files were present.
