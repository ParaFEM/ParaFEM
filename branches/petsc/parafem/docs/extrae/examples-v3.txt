Running the Examples

This tutorial explains how to run the 10 example programs provided in Chapter 12 of the 5th edition of "Programming the Finite Element Method". 

Linux Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Linux. Click here for a short online Introduction to Linux course.

The programs and tools described in the following sections can be found in the $HOME/parafem/bin directory. To run them from anywhere on the system, the directory needs to be added to the $PATH environment variable.This can be done interactively by typing the following each time you login:

PATH=$PATH:/$HOME/parafem/bin

export PATH

or once by adding the commands above to the .bash_profile file in the $HOME directory.
   

Program 12.1 Linear Elasticity

It is recommended that you run the programs in a directory separate from the ParaFEM source tree. In the home directory, create the new directory $HOME/work/p121_5.

Input Data 

The example input decks for p121_5 are created using the program mg2d. This takes as input a file with the .mg extension. Copy the p121_5_<size>.mg files from $HOME/parafem/examples/mg2d/5th_ed/p121_5 to your new directory. In your new directory type the following (remembering the space and "."):

cp $HOME/parafem/examples/mg2d/5th_ed/p121_5/*.mg .

Build the tiny model by typing:

mg2d p121_5_tiny

If successful this will produce the following files:

p121_5_tiny.d - nodal coordinates and element steering

p121_5_tiny.bnd - restrained nodes

p121_5_tiny.lds - applied forces

p121_5_tiny.dat - program control data


Running the Analysis

Instructions for running the analysis are dependent on the cluster you are using. It typically involves creating a job script that is then submitting to a batch scheduling system. Please check the details with your service provider. An example is given below.

MinoTauro Cluster

Create the job script according to the documentation provided by Barcelona Supercomputing Center. To the bottom of the script, add the line:

srun p121_5 p121_5_tiny

where p121_5_tiny is the name of the model

Submit the job by executing the following command:

mnsubmit debug.sh

You can check the job is running using the command mnq.

If the analysis has completed successfully, the directory will contain the results files:

p121_5_tiny.ensi.DISPL-000001 - displacements
p121_5_tiny.res - basic performance data
