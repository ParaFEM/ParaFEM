# Installing Extrae


1. Install dependencies: libxml2, binutils (bfd and libiberty), zlib)
	See Section 3.5.2 BlueGene/Q in the User Guide: http://www.bsc.es/computer-sciences/performance-tools/trace-generation/extrae/extrae-user-guide
		Note: A static version of libxml2 is required.
		Note: The cross-compiler must be used for binutils.
	
    binutils:
	Unload any MPI modules - shared libraries cause issues.
	
	export CC=/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/gnu-linux/bin/powerpc64-bgq-linux-gcc
	
	./configure --target=i386-pc-linux s390-ibm-linux --prefix=~/binutils
	
	make && make install



    zlib:
	./configure --static --prefix=~/zlib

	make && make install




    libxml2:
	./configure

	make && make install





2. Point the Linux-BGQ prebuilt version of Extrae to the dependencies.




LD_PRELOAD mechanism is not available on IBM machines so we must build with Extrae...




When linking to Extrae and it's dependencies, the order of libraries is wrong in the example (extrae/share/examples/MPI/Makefile):

FLIBS = -L$(EXTRAE_HOME)/lib -lmpitracef $(PAPI_LIBS) -L$(XML2_HOME)/lib $(XML2_LIBS) -L$(ZLIB_HOME)/lib $(ZLIB_LIBS) $(BFD_LIBS)

should be:

FLIBS = -L$(EXTRAE_HOME)/lib -lmpitracef $(PAPI_LIBS) -L$(XML2_HOME)/lib $(XML2_LIBS) $(BFD_LIBS) -L$(ZLIB_HOME)/lib $(ZLIB_LIBS)





# Building w/ Extrae
1. Static linking is required (See joule_extrae.inc - line 67 for example)
   This file is in the ~parafem/parafem/build directory.
2. Ensure all environment variables are set before building (See joule_extrae_vars.sh for example)




# Running w/ Extrae
1. Ensure you have a configuration XML file for Extrae (See extrae.xml for example)
2. Check the binary defined in the XML (See extrae.xml - line 66 for example)
3. Ensure the job script points to the XML file (See ll_trace.sh - line 3 and line 21)
4. Submit as usual.
