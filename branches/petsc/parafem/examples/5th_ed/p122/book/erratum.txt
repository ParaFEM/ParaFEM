The file p122_medium.res here is slightly different from the book.

In the book, E=10000 in the file p122_medium.mg, however the published
results of the analysis are for a problem where E=100. The displacements in
the book are too high. Here, they are reasonable. The stress values for
both values of E are the same in both cases.
