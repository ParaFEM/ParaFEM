This is an example directory tree for tests on the bone examples.

svn export it to a working directory and fill in the zero-sized files
and update the .dat files in normal and normal_metis.  Or svn export
directly from the URL.

Don't use cp (or svn co):  that will create .svn files and if you
accidentally commit the working directory with the large .d files,
then all of that will go into the repository.
