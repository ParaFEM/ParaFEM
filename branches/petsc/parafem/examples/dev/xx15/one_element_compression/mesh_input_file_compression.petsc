# The combination MINRES/Jacobi in PETSc 3.6.3 gives an error for this test
# because the residual becomes exactly zero.  PETSc MINRES is corrected in
# PETSc dev and this will be in a future PETSc release.  In the meantime
# use conjugate gradient - we want to test the ParaFEM-PETSc interface, not
# PETSc.
