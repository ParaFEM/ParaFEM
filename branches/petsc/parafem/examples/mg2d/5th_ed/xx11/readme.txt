  INPUT DATA: xx11-<size>.mg

  Input data for program mg2d.f90, which creates the input decks required
  for the built in problems of Chapter 12, Smith I.M. and Griffiths D.V., 
  "Programming the Finite Element Method", 4th Edition, Wiley, 2004.

    USAGE: mg2d xx11-<size>.mg

  Known Issues: 

  1. Refers to program 'p123'. Program mg2d needs to be modified to recognise
     program 'xx11'. Once this has been done, 'p123' in the data file can be
     replaced by 'xx11'.
