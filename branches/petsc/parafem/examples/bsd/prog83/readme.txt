The files in this directory comprise several example input decks to use with 
program prog83 in the textbook by Beer, Smith and Duenser. The text appended
to the files: <small>, <medium> and <giant>, denote the problem size.

  USAGE: prog83
  
The program needs the following files as input: job.dat, coord.dat, load.dat
and plane.dat. No command line argument is expected. The user is expected to
copy the content of job-<size>.dat to job.dat, coord-<size>.dat to coord.dat
and so on.
